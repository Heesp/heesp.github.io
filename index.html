        </div>

        <div class="hobby-item hobby-money">
          <h3>Money</h3>
          <p>I said I consider web-development a hobby, because it is so enjoyable for me, I can spend few days in a row working on a project or learning new things about a feature. Now, when I got a formal education in the subject, I love it even more. </p>
          <p>My interests don’t stop at only web languages, like JavaScript. I realised I have a skill and passion for coding in general, and recently I started looking into game development as another potential money-generating hobby, using Unity and C#.</p>
          <img src="img/6hobbies/hobby_money_icon.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="hobby-item hobby-shape">
          <h3>Shape</h3>
          <p>Ever since I first saw a Jackie Chan movie, I was fascinated with martial arts. The art of mastering your own body always appealed to me. I love martial arts because to master them you have to constantly push yourself and be a better version of your yesterday’s self.</p>
          <p>When I moved to Vancouver my friend recommended me a master, who teaches krav maga. So now, twice a week, you can find me at the gym throwing kicks and punches and torturing myself with exercises.</p>
          <img src="img/6hobbies/hobby_shape_icon.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="hobby-item hobby-create">
          <h3>Creativity</h3>
          <p>I have been a gamer for my whole life. I think video games are the most complete art form humanity has created. To any good game there is a story, music, art, game design and much, much more.</p>
          <p>However, only recently I picked up the hobby that allows me to fully express my creativity.
          <br>I discovered the world of table-top RPGs, such as “Dungeon and Dragons”. I began creating my own world, my own stories, landscapes and people and I am not stopping any time soon.</p>
