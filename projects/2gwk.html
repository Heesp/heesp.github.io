          <h2 class="project-heading-2">My role</h2>
          <p>I am the lead UX/UI Designer, the Product Owner and the head of the IT team.
          </br>I am coordinating the project and presenting our design solutions to the founders, Patrick and Sergio. 
          </br>I also oversee the team of 2 developers and do the QA for their work.</p>
              
          <h2 class="project-heading-2">Our Users</h2>
          <p>Main audience of the company is busy people, who are keeping a healthy diet. These people don‚Äôt have a lot of time to go back and forth between pages or wait for the page to reload 10 times. They want to order what they want to eat and fast.
          </p>

          <h2 class="project-heading-2">Outcome</h2>
          <p>At the end of the day, the new platform was launched in time, with multiple new features implemented since then. We have heard uplifting positive feedback from our customers, the sales went up at least 10% and I learned a lot all throughout the project.</p>

          <h2 class="project-heading-2">Problem Statement</h2>
              <p>The process of customizing dishes was confusing for people.
              <br>The modifications were added when the dish was already in the cart, without reference to its ingredients or nutritional details. The action of customization itself would also prompt the page to be reloaded multiple times, which introduced an unnecessary delay in the user journey.
              <br>The goal was to simplify and speed up this process.</p>

            <ul class="project-requirements">
              <li> <span>Time</span> We had to launch the newly revamped website before the year 2019 started. That meant we had less than 2 months to complete the project.</li>
              <li><span>Tech</span> The website is Wordpress based, using WooCommerce as its e-commerce platform. This meant the solution we implemented had to be already available in the market in the form of plugins.</li>
              <li> <span>Code</span> There is a custom Delivery Options plugin used during the checkout process. This feature was crucial and had to remain unchanged with the new solution.</li>

              Breaking down the pain point showed multiple issues. The process of ordering customized dishes was taking too long and it was uncomfortable. It was disjointed, and customers had to go back to products frequently.

            <p>
                For each step of the user flow I developed interactive wireframes to have a clear idea of what user journeys would look like. The prototypes were both low and high fidelity.

            <p>
             Every aspect of the project involved a lot of complexity, to make sure we had the right solution, I developed multiple iterations of the features. The prototype iterations were low or high fidelity depending on the level of complexity.

          <div class="project-overview">
            <p>
              After the wireframes were approved, the time has come for the UI redesign. At the time there was no defined styles for the website, so I cooperated with our Graphic Designer to establish and create the styleguide like this. This set in stone the brand colors and typography.

          <p>
            At the beginning the team consisted only of the Developer and myself, so we had a very short feedback loop, but to make his life easier, I developed a number of UI kits like this. This way I could ensure the final result will be as close as possible to what I designed.
