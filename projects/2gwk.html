          <h2 class="project-heading-2">Problem Statement</h2>
            <div>
              <p>The process of customizing dishes was confusing for people.</p>
              
              <p>The modifications were added when the dish was already in the cart, without reference to its ingredients or nutritional details. 
              <br>The action of customization itself would also prompt the page to be reloaded multiple times, which introduced an unnecessary delay in the user journey.</p>
              
              <p>The goal was to simplify and speed up this process.</p>

          The project was launched on December 29th, with the first menu going live on January 31st. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There were quite a few bugs and issues at launch since the testing was minimized due to time constraints. For a few weeks, we worked in a crisis firefighter mode, but overall, the project was a success. 
        </p>
        <p>
          After we cleaned up the bugs, we received a tonne of positive feedback and the sales numbers increased 20%.
